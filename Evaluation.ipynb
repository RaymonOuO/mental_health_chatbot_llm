At the same time, who you are may change according to what experiences you have had and how you have dealt with them or felt about them. Try viewing the journey of finding yourself as exciting and ongoing. Allow yourself to feel emotions and learn how they relate to the experiences you have.

The more you practice, the more confident you'll feel. It's also important to know your audience. Who are they? What do they want? What do they need? How can you connect with them?
